          I am a Computer Science grad from the University of Waterloo. I am extremely intersted about uncovering insights from data.
          In exploring this passion, I have worked as a data engineer, data scientist, and a PM.
          <br><br>
          When it comes to technology, I measure humanity's progress by how societies' less fortunate is impacted, not what's on the cutting edge. My goal is to develop the skills and resources to make an impact on this techonlogical front.
          <br><br>
          My recent readings in my spare time have been around tech history, economics, and sci-fi. I spend the rest of my time playing soccer.
          <br><br>
          Having grown up in quiet suburbs of Waterloo, I'm extremely excited to be traveling around Europe and Asia this summer!
